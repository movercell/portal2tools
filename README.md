# Portal 2 Compile Tools

This repository contains custom versions of the Source Engine compile tools to be used with Portal 2. These are based on the ported Source 2013 compiler code from [Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop](https://github.com/ReactiveDrop/reactivedrop_public_src), and built against [Emulsion SDK](https://github.com/theKlaxon/emulsion-sdk/) in order to be compatible with Portal 2.

Currently, building VBSP, VVIS, and VRAD is supported. HLMV code [from the 2006 SDK](https://github.com/Source-SDK-Archives/source-sdk-2006-ep1/tree/master/utils/hlmv) is included, but probably won't compile yet.

Heavily work in progress at the moment. Some Portal 2 features still aren't properly supported, there are numerous bugs and not really any new features yet. No releases are provided for now, but you can build them from source if you want to try them out or contribute.
